Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) do better by using parallel (multiple threads working together) and concurrent (gc threads working while the mutator is running) techniques however pauses still cost time and in the case of online transactions money. This talk will discuss a new GC algorithm being developed at Red Hat for OpenJDK. Shenandoah is the first open-source OpenJDK GC algorithm that does marking and evacuation concurrently with running Java threads. This allows us to keep our pause times under 10ms even for heaps of 100+GBs. by Christine Flood - Red Hat Christine H. Flood has been designing and implementing programming languages for over 20 years. Starting with Lisp machines, dabbling with implicitly parallel languages like ID and Fortress and diving into the bits of Java Virtual Machine implementations. She's written multiple papers on GC algorithms and is delighted to be taking them to the next level for OpenJDK."220,9/22/14,Martin Thompson,1,tM4YskS94b0,,"""Aeron: Open-source high-performance messaging"" by Martin Thompson","Does TCP not meet your required latency consistently? Is UDP not reliable enough? Do you need to multicast? What about flow control, congestion control, and a means to avoid head of line blocking that can be integrated with the application? Or perhaps youÕre just fascinated by how to design for the cutting edge of performance? Maybe you have tried higher level messaging products and found they are way too complicated because of the feature bloat driven by product marketing cycles. Aeron takes it back-to-basics with a pure focus on performance and reliability. We have built it from the ground up with mechanical sympathy in its DNA. The data structures are lock-free, wait-free, copy-free, and even persistent for our functional friends. Interaction with the media is layered so you can swap between UDP, Inifiniband, or Shared Memory as required. Aeron is open-source with implementations in Java and C++ that interoperate. There are no unnecessary features to bloat the implementation, yet the design is open so that it can be composed into higher level abstractions. This talk will focus on the design of Aeron and what we learned trying to achieve very consistent performance. We will explore the challenges of dealing with reliable message delivery over UDP and the data structures necessary to support transmission and retransmission in in a lock-free and wait-free manner. by Martin Thompson (@mjpt777) Martin is a high-performance and low-latency specialist, with experience gained over two decades working on the bleeding edge of large transactional and big-data systems.

Onyx is a new distributed computation system written in Clojure that addresses these problems head-on. Hardware advancements in the last 10 years have enabled new designs that leverage fast networks and SSDs. Onyx takes advantage and adapts to this new environment.

Incorrect error handling often leads to security vulnerabilities (such as many of the recent spate of bugs found in TLS implementations), data loss, and user frustration. In this talk, we'll first discuss why programs using existing error handling styles and mechanisms (return and status code checking, conditions and restarts, and exceptions) often fail to recover correctly from errors. We argue that this is due to a fundamental conflict between encapsulation and having enough information to recover a consistent state.Then we explain how this conflict can be solved by providing language support for automatically recovering the state before the call that failed, so that failures cannot cause inconsistency. We also describe how the 'Ken' protocol complements this automatic recovery and extends it to asynchronous and distributed systems. by Daira Hopwood (@DairaHopwood) - LeastAuthority.com Daira Hopwood works on cloud storage systems for LeastAuthority.com.

It is built on Mono, scripted in C#, and exports to a wide range of systems, including OSX, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, XBox, PlayStation, and the web. We are providing an open-source library integrating Clojure and Unity. Clojure will dramatically improve game development by bringing Lisp-style REPL-based live coding, optimizing macros, and DSLs to Unity's workflow. Persistent data structures will enable previously impossible computations in games, such as speculative AI algorithms, logic programming, and rewindable game state history. Unity's graphics and interaction stack opens up considerable power to Clojure programmers. Optimized 2D and 3D graphics, physics simulations, and integration with hardware such as the Kinect are examples of what is now available to functional programmers. Unity's extensive community and collection of prepackaged assets will make developing games in Clojure practical for the first time. Our talk will cover the indispensable role of platforms like Unity in professional game development, and the new possibilities afforded by its integration with a functional Lisp like Clojure.

So when I found myself having to build a system with real deliverable size constraints, my only options seemed to be JS itself, or TypeScript, which doesn't add much to JS but at least provides a modicum of type checking. After a few months of fighting TypeScript, though, I'd had enough. Happily, my frustration coincided with the advent of PureScript. At first glance, PureScript looks and feels like Haskell, but there's hardly any extraneous machinery. The PureScript compiler generates very concise JS, and the language itself is designed with the platform's constraints in mind. Yet it offers things like higher kinded polymorphism, type classes and similar deep Haskell magic. More appealingly, it comes with a growing number of libraries for coping with the browser as a platform: functional DOM manipulation, reactive programming, and more.

Allowing types to be controlled by ordinary values allows us to prove many more properties about our programs and enables some interesting forms of metaprogramming. We can do interesting things like write a type-safe printf or verify algebraic laws of data structures - but while dependent types are quickly gaining in popularity, it can be tricky to find examples which are both useful and introductory. This talk will demonstrate some practical dependent typing examples (and not sized vectors) using Idris, a language designed for writing executable programs, rather than just proving theorems. by Brian McKenna (@puf nfresh) Brian McKenna is a small contributor to the Idris and PureScript languages. He also makes video tutorials on writing programs in Idris so that others can get started with dependent types.

Most problematic is that this approach keeps us from composing core algorithms in a context-independent way which would facilitate reuse and engender greater flexibility. This talk will describe transducers, a new library feature for Clojure (but of interest to other languages) that emphasizes composable, context-free, intermediate-free notions like 'mapping' and 'filtering' and their concrete reuse across all of the contexts above. by Rich Hickey (@richhickey) - Cognitect Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure and designer of Datomic, is a software developer with over 25 years of experience in various domains.

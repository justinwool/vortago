Countless varieties of plants and animals were bred by the world's peoples for talents specific to every soil, climate, and human culture. Most of them have been lost---their hard-won genetic sophistication extinguished. But many have survived, thanks to professional and amateur devotion, and they are wondrous---living embodiments of humanity's deepest traditions. Photojournalist Jim Richardson has been covering the agricultural beat for National Geographic since 1984. His spectacular photographs, and the stories he tells with them, are renowned. This highlight clip is excerpted from a lecture given as part of the Seminars About Long-term Thinking, a project of The Long Now Foundation.

This Friday, March 12, astronaut RUSTY SCHWEICKART will give a public lecture titled ""The Asteroid Threat Over the Next 100,000 Years."" It will detail graphically the results of his research on asteroid impact frequency and damage, along with what it will take to find and deflect future threatening asteroids. Rusty Schweickart was trained in astronautics at MIT, flew as a fighter jock with the Air Force, and became one of the pioneer ""science"" astronauts. On the Apollo 9 mission in 1969 he was the first to test-pilot the Lunar Lander and was one of the first to space-walk without an umbilical. He chaired the California Energy Commission and founded the Association of Space Explorers. He currently runs the B612 Foundation, which champions techniques for heading off future asteroid impacts.

But he wanted to contrast those with success stories like Tokugawa-era Japan, which wholly reversed its lethal deforestation, and Iceland, which learned to finesse a highly fragile and subtle environment...

Kennedy knows politics. For decades a major player himself in Washington DC, he has written redefining biographies of Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr. Kennedy knows history. Besides writing and hosting a number of television series on American history, he wrote Rediscovering America and Hidden Cities: The Discovery and Loss of Ancient North American Civilization. And Kennedy knows natural systems. As a highly popular Director of the National Park Service, he pushed the whole Park System toward greater emphasis on science. Roger Kennedy also found the mountain in Nevada where The Long Now Foundation aims to build the 10,000-year Clock. In this talk he defines the continental frame of the Clock.
